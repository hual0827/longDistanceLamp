# Long Distance Lamp | Object Final Project

This project is a solution that provides long distance couples with a communication tool outside of our normal text or voice based communications. Two lamps use an [ESP8266](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17146), [Arudino's IoT Cloud](https://www.arduino.cc/en/IoT/HomePage), and an [HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569) to activate and sync the lamp with motion on either end. The color is adjusted using a webpage served from the ESP using an mDNS hostname, lamp.local.
